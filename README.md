# 🎨 Interactive Image Colorization Tool - Master Plan

## 🚀 Project Goal
Build a web-based tool that allows users to upload real-world images (like houses), manually draw outlines to define regions (walls, windows, doors), and then apply colors or textures to each region. The final image can be exported as a PNG, without showing outlines, reflecting the visual changes.

---

## 📦 MVP Features

### 1. Image Upload
- Upload a real photo (JPG/PNG).
- Display image on canvas.

### 2. Drawing Tool
- Pencil/brush for manual outline drawing.
- Adjustable brush size.
- Snap to grid (optional for future).

### 3. Region Segmentation
- Detect closed paths to create fillable regions.
- Store paths as vector data (SVG/JSON).

### 4. Clickable Region Selection
- User clicks inside a region to select it.
- Visual highlight/selection feedback.

### 5. Fill Options
- Solid color fill per region.
- Texture/pattern fill per region (via CanvasPattern or masked drawImage).

### 6. Outline Visibility Toggle
- Toggle outlines on/off for clean preview.

### 7. Export Tool
- Export as PNG (image + applied changes, no outlines).
- Optionally export project as JSON (for future editing).

---

## 🧠 Advanced Features (Phase 2+)
- Undo/Redo for drawing and filling.
- Zoom/pan support for large images.
- AI-based segmentation suggestion (Segment Anything Model).
- Layer system (future proofing).
- Mobile support (React Native/PWA).

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Purpose              | Tool/Library        |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Framework            | React.js / Next.js  |
| Canvas & Drawing     | Konva.js / Fabric.js|
| Region Detection     | Custom (Flood fill, Marching Squares) |
| UI                   | Tailwind CSS + Headless UI |
| Export               | Canvas API / Konva export |

## 🧪 Development Phases

### Phase 1 – MVP (Weeks 1–3)
- Image upload + canvas setup
- Drawing outlines
- Click detection on region
- Color fill + PNG export

### Phase 2 – UX & Power (Weeks 4–5)
- Texture support
- Outline toggle
- Undo/redo, zoom/pan

### Phase 3 – Intelligence Layer (Week 6+)
- AI-based auto segmentation
- Project save/load
- UX polish for commercial use

---

## ✅ Success Criteria
- Usable without tutorials (intuitive UI)
- Fast, responsive, exportable output
- Focused on homeowners, architects, DIY designers

---

## 💡 Monetization Potential
- Freemium model (free coloring, paid export or textures)
- White-label for interior/architect firms
- API for bulk image segmentation

---

## 📝 Next Steps
- [ ] Finalize UI wireframes
- [ ] Build React canvas prototype
- [ ] Implement region segmentation logic
- [ ] Connect color/texture fill
- [ ] Add export functionality
